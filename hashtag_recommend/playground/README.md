To be completely honest, attempting to implement word clustering is a first for me as well. Therefore, in preparation, I've created an exercise involving pre-training on movie titles and descriptions to measure similarity before receiving hashtags. I apologize for any embarrassment, but I'd appreciate it if you could kindly overlook it. The reference link I used can be found [here](https://wikidocs.net/24603).
